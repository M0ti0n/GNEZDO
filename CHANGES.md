# Changes by test build

Newest first. Each build is the `test-build` release; earlier builds (up to 7 Nov 2026) were made on every change to main.

## Next build

**New**
- Process → **Auto cut**: the sheet with the AUTO CUT panel. Select mode: Multi sheet (every sheet; saves a new job first), Selected sheet, Selected parts (SELECT, click parts in cut order; drag or ▲▼ in the list to change it; trace box per part), Trace, Cut internal. PROCESS works out the cut path: tracing, holes, then the outline; parts in another part's hole first; big parts last within their box; then the path generation rule (bottom to top, left to right, right to left, top to bottom, shortest distance, smallest to biggest). Leads from Leads & cutting and the Technology table. Picked parts are faded with a glow; processed parts show only their cut and trace lines, with lead-ins (green), lead-outs (red) and travel (dashed). The cut path is saved with the job
- Processed sheets show their cut path in the sheet view of Automatic nest and in EDIT / VIEW too (Job search keeps the plain view). AUTO CUT panel in the app's style; Selected parts list: cut order numbers (they stay put when parts are dragged), part names, trace boxes; ten rows to start, growing, then scrolling; Up / Down below it. PROCESS shows two gears
- Settings → Machines → Machine → **Folders**: per machine, the NC folder (required; or tick to download NC programs in the browser instead) and the job folder with "Also write every saved job as a file" (off: jobs only in the database). The server writes there; Check tests a folder. NC output → Try it: Save to the NC folder

**Changed**
- The Windows server package is now called `gnezdo-server-windows.zip` (was `gnezdo-windows.zip`)
- Machine → Cut order: holes first and parts inside other parts first are always applied (no longer checkboxes); only Big parts last stays, and it outranks the order picked under Auto cut. The directions (bottom to top, left to right, shortest travel) move to Auto cut
- Big parts last holds only for the parts in the big part's bounding box; parts elsewhere are cut in the Auto cut order

## Build 11 Nov 2026 (`ba40568`)

**New**
- Settings → Machines, four tabs per machine:
  - **Machine**: what it cuts (common cut, open cut, tracing, holes), cut order rules (bottom to top / left to right / shortest travel, holes first, parts inside other parts first, big parts last), Export / Import machine as a `.zip`
  - **Technology**: cutting tables per thickness (kerf, speeds, small holes, pierce time, leads, gaps, angles); import from a `.DBF` material table, pick which technologies, export CSV; new thickness = a copy of the next thicker row
  - **Leads & cutting**: six lead-in / lead-out pair types with drawings; which one the automatic cut uses on sharp corners and elsewhere, for outlines and holes
  - **NC output**: the machine's postprocessor (a JavaScript file it carries), file extension, try it on a sample plate; a generic ISO postprocessor to start from
- Reports (toolbar → Report):
  - **Nest report**: A4 page per sheet with machine, job, sheet data, estimated times, weights, the sheet drawn to scale with part numbers and rulers, and the parts table; print all, only changed pages or chosen pages
  - **Cost report**: price per part from weight and cutting time, per project, prices per material, fixed cost, sum
- Importer: **Scale** tool (type a size with a unit, e.g. `200mm`, or a scale factor, e.g. `2`; the input box opens at the picked line)
- Job search: sheet preview 2 × 2 or one per row; send a sheet's parts to a job open in a tab; Machine column and filter; materials, thicknesses and projects as small bubbles
- Process section: Break cut, Micro joint, Lead in / out, Movement and Remnant tools (icons only, they do nothing yet)
- Settings and Rules: Close under the categories (back to Home)

**Changed**
- Importer: Properties button in the standard size, 8 px between tools (room for one more tool on a 1080p screen)
- Nest report: part numbers 50 % bigger, placed on the part's material
- Result lists: scroll bars always shown
- README brought up to date with the roadmap; neutral sample names in the demo data

## Build 9 Nov 2026 (`06279ac`)

**New**
- Common cut: importer tool and color list, a nesting rule per part; Custom nest joins copies along their common cut lines into blocks; Manual nest snaps marked lines together and Arrange makes blocks
- Manual nest: Ctrl selects several parts
- Importer: line colors from your own lists (exact HEX / AutoCAD colors, any shade, grays) for cut contour, trace and open cut; lines shown in the color of their operation
- Process section: Auto cut and Manual cut tools (icons only)

**Changed**
- Importer: Folder import and File import are buttons; panel buttons light green on hover
- Work parts: removing a nested part asks first and takes its pieces off the sheets
- A DXF / DWG dropped anywhere goes to the importer (the browser no longer opens dropped files)
- Job toolbar: section tiles 140 px, the same whether a section is open or not (everything fits a 1080p screen, also at 125 %)

**Fixed**
- Common cut trials: placed parts counted first, the best trial kept when stopped

## Build 8 Nov 2026, 23:19 (`ddf91c7`)

**Fixed**
- Desktop: GNEZDO no longer stops when Firefox drops the window's connection (it stops 30 s after the window closes)

## Build 8 Nov 2026, 22:22 (`0bfa12c`)

**Fixed**
- A remnant / DXF sheet from Add sheet is never merged into identical stock
- Qty req not set: the tile cannot be dragged and says why
- Failed solutions no longer lock a part's material

## Build 8 Nov 2026, 21:53 (`48d6f16`)

**New**
- Manual nest → Add sheet: ADD FROM REMNANT and ADD FROM DXF (size and shape from the file)
- Manual nest: tiles green from Qty req to Qty max, red below and above; no dragging beyond Qty max

**Changed**
- Import: the file list is the drop area; Add files… / Add folder… next to Clear list

**Fixed**
- DXF remnants with a repeated point in the outline broke nesting
- AUTOMATIC NEST from Work parts no longer opens Manual nest
- Desktop packages: the program starts as the desktop build wherever it is started from

## Build 8 Nov 2026, 19:48 (`7f385de`)

**New**
- Test builds only when asked, not on every change
- Settings → Data: the desktop's data folder (open, back up); the server's database (admin can change it); the server's first start asks for the database in the browser

**Changed**
- Work parts: material and thickness locked while the part is on the sheets of any solution
- Arrange: a second copy turned 180° is tried lined up with the first (trapezoids, L shapes interlock)
- Sheet properties: a sheet can be turned through a position outside the cutting area

**Fixed**
- Job search: the selected job's saved nest is drawn (was an empty placeholder); material / thickness buttons pick the sheets too
